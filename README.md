# IP-ID-Prediction
We propose a tool based on machine learning technology, consisting of IP ID identification and IP ID prediction algorithms, which can be used to classify five types of IP ID behavior and measure IP ID prediction ability online.
The predictive mechanism we developed is modular and can be easily integrated into existing IP ID applications to capture appropriate IP IDs from the Internet.
Furthermore, we demonstrate a new port detection approach that is based on IP ID predictions and implement a lightweight stealth port scan with 96.4% accuracy, suitable for large-scale network scanning.
