# ZPredict
We propose a tool to infer useful information from IP ID values which consists of IP ID identification and IP ID prediction algorithms based on machine learning technology to automatically classify five types of IP ID behavior and measure IP ID prediction ability online.
The predictive mechanism we developed is modular and can be easily integrated into existing IP ID applications to capture appropriate IP IDs from the Internet.
